<p>Iâ€™m <u>super excited!</u> to announce that <strong>Krzysztof Kamrowski has joined teonite as an Art &amp; Creative
    Director</strong> (which I've been waiting for for over a decade! since I first got to know Krzysztof!).<br></p><p>
    Teonite has over 12y of experience in bringing exceptional services and venture products to the market. Still, as an
    art and design lover, I have always felt that our capabilities and services can be taken to the next level.<br></p>
<p>Krzysztof has extensive (over 22 years) experience in web design, motion, and VFX industries â€” working for (to name a
    few): <a href="https://platige.com">Platige Image</a> (<a href="https://platige.com/project/feature/fallen-art/">Fallen
        Art</a>, <a href="https://platige.com/project/game-cinematics/the-witcher-intro/">The Witcher</a> â€” Cinematics,
    Pitbull), Axis Animation (Halo 4 â€” Cinematics), tv commercials (T-Mobile, Orange, Alior Bankâ€¦). Do not take my word
    for it â€” <strong>just look at his demo reel </strong>(which I recommend full screen with headphones ðŸ˜€):</p>
